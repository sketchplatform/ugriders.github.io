Who We Are
</h2></center>

<center><h3>
uGRiD stands for "Undergraduate Researchers interested in Data". We're a low-key group that consists of Five College students. You may find other motivated students to work on interesting projects together or open a dialogue about what you've been working on/ thinking about if you want to.

<center><h4><i>
Since there is a rapidly growing interest in data science in the area, the goal of the group is to provide a social base for like-minded Five College students. Basically, it's like DataFest with more dialogue with more than one group and with data from local and online businesses.
